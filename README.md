Rip the Pokémon icons (aka party sprites, box sprites, minis, ...) from
_Pokémon X_, and probably also _Pokémon Y_.  (I don't have a dump of _Y_ to
test it on.)

This is an obviously-not-finished-yet Haskell port of [pokemon-x-y-icons]
(https://github.com/Zhorken/pokemon-x-y-icons), which I wrote in Python.
